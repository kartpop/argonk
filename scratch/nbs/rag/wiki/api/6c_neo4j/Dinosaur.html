  <b>Dinosaurs</b> are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade
  <b>Dinosauria</b>. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243
  and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of
  the evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the
  dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event
  201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous
  periods. The fossil record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having
  evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the
  only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene
  extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into
  <b>avian dinosaurs</b>—birds—and the extinct <b>non-avian dinosaurs</b>, which
  are all dinosaurs other than birds.
</p>
<p>
  Dinosaurs are varied from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints.
  Birds, at over 11,000 living species, are among the most diverse groups of
  vertebrates. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 900
  distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs.
  Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds)
  and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds
  were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed
  dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted
  since the 1970s, however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals
  with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction.
  Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that all
  dinosaurs were egg-laying, and that nest-building was a trait shared by many
  dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.
</p>
<p>
  While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included
  quadrupedal species, and some were able to shift between these stances.
  Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all
  dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such
  as bony armor and spines. While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian
  lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many
  prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied—the largest
  sauropod dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of 39.7 meters (130
  feet) and heights of 18 m (59 ft) and were the largest land animals of all
  time. The misconception that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is
  based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy bones are more likely to
  last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small, some
  measuring about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length.
</p>
<p>
  The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the
  name "dinosaur" (meaning "terrible lizard") being coined by Sir Richard Owen
  in 1842 to refer to these "great fossil lizards". Since then, mounted fossil
  dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums worldwide, and
  dinosaurs have become an enduring part of popular culture. The large sizes of
  some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature,
  have ensured their regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as
  the <i>Jurassic Park</i> franchise. Persistent public enthusiasm for the
  animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new
  discoveries are regularly covered by the media.
</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>
  Under phylogenetic nomenclature, dinosaurs are usually defined as the group
  consisting of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of <i>Triceratops</i> and
  modern birds (Neornithes), and all its descendants. It has also been suggested
  that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the MRCA of <i>Megalosaurus</i> and
  <i>Iguanodon</i>, because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard
  Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. Both definitions cover the same known
  genera: Dinosauria = Ornithischia + Saurischia. This includes major groups
  such as ankylosaurians (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), stegosaurians (plated
  herbivorous quadrupeds), ceratopsians (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores with
  neck frills), pachycephalosaurians (bipedal herbivores with thick skulls),
  ornithopods (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including "duck-bills"),
  theropods (mostly bipedal carnivores and birds), and sauropodomorphs (mostly
  large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails).
</p>
<p>
  Birds are the sole surviving dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were
  considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct
  superorder. However, most contemporary paleontologists reject the traditional
  style of classification based on anatomical similarity, in favor of
  phylogenetic taxonomy based on deduced ancestry, in which each group is
  defined as all descendants of a given founding genus. Birds belong to the
  dinosaur subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods,
  which are saurischians.
</p>
<p>
  Research by Matthew G. Baron, David B. Norman, and Paul M. Barrett in 2017
  suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis
  by Baron <i>et al.</i> recovered the Ornithischia as being closer to the
  Theropoda than the Sauropodomorpha, as opposed to the traditional union of
  theropods with sauropodomorphs. This would cause sauropods and kin to fall
  outside traditional dinosaurs, so they re-defined Dinosauria as the last
  common ancestor of <i>Triceratops horridus</i>, <i>Passer domesticus</i> and
  <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>, and all of its descendants, to ensure that
  sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs. They also resurrected the
  clade Ornithoscelida to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and
  Theropoda.
</p>

<h3>General description</h3>
<p>
  Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs can be generally described as
  archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath the body. Other prehistoric
  animals, including pterosaurs, mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and
  <i>Dimetrodon</i>, while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, are not
  taxonomically classified as dinosaurs. Pterosaurs are distantly related to
  dinosaurs, being members of the clade Ornithodira. The other groups mentioned
  are, like dinosaurs and pterosaurs, members of Sauropsida (the reptile and
  bird clade), except <i>Dimetrodon</i> (which is a synapsid). None of them had
  the erect hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs.
</p>
<p>
  Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic Era,
  especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Other groups of animals were
  restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size
  of a domestic cat and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.
  Dinosaurs have always been recognized as an extremely varied group: over 900
  non-avian dinosaur genera have been confidently identified (2018) with 1124
  species (2016). Estimates put the total number of dinosaur genera preserved in
  the fossil record at 1850, nearly 75% still undiscovered, and the number that
  ever existed (in or out of the fossil record) at 3,400. A 2016 estimate put
  the number of dinosaur species living in the Mesozoic at 1,543–2,468, compared
  to the number of modern-day birds (avian dinosaurs) at 10,806 species.
</p>
<p>
  Extinct dinosaurs, as well as modern birds, include genera that are
  herbivorous and others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters,
  insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are
  all modern birds), some evolved into quadrupeds, and others, such as
  <i>Anchisaurus</i> and <i>Iguanodon</i>, could walk as easily on two or four
  legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian
  traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although the best-known
  genera are remarkable for their large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were
  human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size.
  Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had
  achieved global distribution by the Early Jurassic epoch at latest. Modern
  birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there
  is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as <i>Microraptor</i>) could
  fly or at least glide, and others, such as spinosaurids, had semiaquatic
  habits.
</p>

<h2>Paleobiology</h2>
<p>
  Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil
  records, including fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers,
  impressions of skin, internal organs and other soft tissues. Many fields of
  study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics
  (especially biomechanics), chemistry, biology, and the Earth sciences (of
  which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and
  study have been dinosaur size and behavior.
</p>

<h3>Size</h3>
<link
  rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"
  href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1236090951"
/>

<p>
  Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the
  Triassic, Early Jurassic, Late Jurassic and Cretaceous. Predatory theropod
  dinosaurs, which occupied most terrestrial carnivore niches during the
  Mesozoic, most often fall into the 100-to-1,000 kg (220-to-2,200 lb) category
  when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on order of magnitude,
  whereas recent predatory carnivoran mammals peak in the 10-to-100 kg
  (22-to-220 lb) category. The mode of Mesozoic dinosaur body masses is between
  1 and 10 metric tons (1.1 and 11.0 short tons). This contrasts sharply with
  the average size of Cenozoic mammals, estimated by the National Museum of
  Natural History as about 2 to 5 kg (4.4 to 11.0 lb).
</p>
<p>
  The sauropods were the largest and heaviest dinosaurs. For much of the
  dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their
  habitat, and the largest was an order of magnitude more massive than anything
  else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as
  <i>Paraceratherium</i> (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the
  giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size.
  There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods,
  including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity,
  but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are
  more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time
  in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with
  lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found
  in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to
  eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in
  such environments.
</p>

<h4>Largest and smallest</h4>
<p>
  Scientists will probably never be certain of the largest and smallest
  dinosaurs to have ever existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of
  animals were ever fossilized and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few
  non-avian dinosaur specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and
  impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete
  skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar,
  better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and
  other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated
  guesswork.
</p>

<p>
  The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is
  <i>Giraffatitan brancai</i> (previously classified as a species of
  <i>Brachiosaurus</i>). Its remains were discovered in Tanzania between 1907
  and 1912. Bones from several similar-sized individuals were incorporated into
  the skeleton now mounted and on display at the Museum für Naturkunde in
  Berlin; this mount is 12 meters (39 ft) tall and 21.8 to 22.5 meters (72 to
  74 ft) long, and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between
  <span>30<span>000</span></span> and <span>60<span>000</span></span
  > kilograms (<span>70<span>000</span></span> and
  <span>130<span>000</span></span
  > lb). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27 meters (89 ft) long
  <i>Diplodocus</i>, which was discovered in Wyoming in the United States and
  displayed in Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 1907. The
  longest dinosaur known from good fossil material is <i>Patagotitan</i>: the
  skeleton mount in the American Museum of Natural History in New York is 37
  meters (121 ft) long. The Museo Municipal Carmen Funes in Plaza Huincul,
  Argentina, has an <i>Argentinosaurus</i> reconstructed skeleton mount that is
  39.7 meters (130 ft) long.
</p>

<p>
  There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a
  small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest herbivorous specimens
  on record were discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive
  <i>Argentinosaurus</i>, which may have weighed
  <span>80<span>000</span></span> to <span>100<span>000</span></span> kilograms
  (88 to 110 short tons) and reached lengths of 30 to 40 meters (98 to 131 ft);
  some of the longest were the 33.5-meter (110 ft) long
  <i>Diplodocus hallorum</i> (formerly <i>Seismosaurus</i>), the 33-to-34-meter
  (108 to 112 ft) long <i>Supersaurus</i>, and 37-meter (121 ft) long
  <i>Patagotitan</i>; and the tallest, the 18-meter (59 ft) tall
  <i>Sauroposeidon</i>, which could have reached a sixth-floor window. There
  were a few dinosaurs that was considered either the heaviest and longest. The
  most famous one include <i>Amphicoelias fragillimus</i>, known only from a now
  lost partial vertebral neural arch described in 1878. Extrapolating from the
  illustration of this bone, the animal may have been 58 meters (190 ft) long
  and weighed <span>122<span>400</span></span
  > kg (<span>269<span>800</span></span
  > lb). However, recent research have placed <i>Amphicoelias</i> from the long,
  gracile diplodocid to the shorter but much stockier rebbachisaurid. Now
  renamed as <i>Maraapunisaurus</i>, this sauropod now stands as much as 40
  meters (130 ft) long and weigh as much as <span>120<span>000</span></span
  > kg (<span>260<span>000</span></span
  > lb). Another contender of this title includes <i>Bruhathkayosaurus</i>, a
  controversial taxon that was recently confirmed to exist after archived photos
  were uncovered. <i>Bruhathkayosaurus</i> was a titanosaur and would have most
  likely weighed more than even <i>Marrapunisaurus</i>. Recent size estimates in
  2023 have placed this sauropod reaching lengths of up to 44 m (144 ft) long
  and a colossal weight range of around <span>110<span>000</span></span
  >–<span>170<span>000</span></span
  > kg (<span>240<span>000</span></span
  >–<span>370<span>000</span></span
  > lb), if these upper estimates up true, <i>Bruhathkayosaurus</i> would have
  rivaled the <i>blue whale</i> and <i>Perucetus colossus</i> as one of the
  largest animals to have ever existed.
</p>
<p>
  The largest carnivorous dinosaur was <i>Spinosaurus</i>, reaching a length of
  12.6 to 18 meters (41 to 59 ft) and weighing 7 to 20.9 metric tons (7.7 to
  23.0 short tons). Other large carnivorous theropods included
  <i>Giganotosaurus</i>, <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>, and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>.
  <i>Therizinosaurus</i> and <i>Deinocheirus</i> were among the tallest of the
  theropods. The largest ornithischian dinosaur was probably the hadrosaurid
  <i>Shantungosaurus giganteus</i> which measured 16.6 meters (54 ft). The
  largest individuals may have weighed as much as 16 metric tons (18 short
  tons).
</p>

<p>
  The smallest dinosaur known is the bee hummingbird, with a length of only 5
  centimeters (2.0 in) and mass of around 1.8 g (0.063 oz). The smallest known
  non-avialan dinosaurs were about the size of pigeons and were those theropods
  most closely related to birds. For example, <i>Anchiornis huxleyi</i> is
  currently the smallest non-avialan dinosaur described from an adult specimen,
  with an estimated weight of 110 g (3.9 oz) and a total skeletal length of 34
  centimeters (1.12 ft). The smallest herbivorous non-avialan dinosaurs included
  <i>Microceratus</i> and <i>Wannanosaurus</i>, at about 60 centimeters (2.0 ft)
  long each.
</p>

<h3>Behavior</h3>
<p>
  Many modern birds are highly social, often found living in flocks. There is
  general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in
  crocodilians (closest living relatives of birds), were also common among
  extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are
  generally based on the pose of skeletons and their habitat, computer
  simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in
  similar ecological niches.
</p>
<p>
  The first potential evidence for herding or flocking as a widespread behavior
  common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of
  31 <i>Iguanodon</i>, ornithischians that were then thought to have perished
  together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole
  and drowned. Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those,
  along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in
  many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of
  herbivores indicate that duck-billed (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great
  herds, like the American bison or the African springbok. Sauropod tracks
  document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different
  species, at least in Oxfordshire, England, although there is no evidence for
  specific herd structures. Congregating into herds may have evolved for
  defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is
  evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various
  theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed
  aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in Inner Mongolia
  that has yielded remains of over 20 <i>Sinornithomimus</i>, from one to seven
  years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped
  in mud. The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to
  depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down
  large prey. However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds,
  crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the taphonomic evidence suggesting
  mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as <i>Deinonychus</i> and
  <i>Allosaurus</i> can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes
  between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.
</p>

<p>
  The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the marginocephalians, theropods
  and lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense,
  and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little
  is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. Head wounds from bites
  suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.
</p>
<p>
  From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was
  discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a
  <i>Velociraptor</i> attacking a <i>Protoceratops</i>, providing evidence that
  dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live
  prey is the partially healed tail of an <i>Edmontosaurus</i>, a hadrosaurid
  dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten
  by a tyrannosaur but survived. Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs
  was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the
  theropod <i>Majungasaurus</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Comparisons between the scleral rings of dinosaurs and modern birds and
  reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs.
  Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day,
  these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as
  dromaeosaurids, <i>Juravenator</i>, and <i>Megapnosaurus</i> were likely
  nocturnal. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as
  ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, ornithomimosaurs may have been
  cathemeral, active during short intervals throughout the day, although the
  small ornithischian <i>Agilisaurus</i> was inferred to be diurnal.
</p>
<p>
  Based on fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as <i>Oryctodromeus</i>, some
  ornithischian species seem to have led a partially fossorial (burrowing)
  lifestyle. Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), and this was also
  true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early
  bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including
  dromaeosaurids) such as <i>Microraptor</i>) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to
  have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs
  moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of
  biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant
  insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles
  and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast
  dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via
  whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.
</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>
  Modern birds communicate by visual and auditory signals, and the wide
  diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as
  horns, frills, crests, sails, and feathers, suggests that visual communication
  has always been important in dinosaur biology. Reconstruction of the plumage
  color of <i>Anchiornis</i> suggest the importance of color in visual
  communication in non-avian dinosaurs. Vocalization in non-avian dinosaurs is
  less certain. In birds, the larynx plays no role in sound production. Instead,
  birds vocalize with a novel organ, the syrinx, farther down the trachea. The
  earliest remains of a syrinx were found in a specimen of the duck-like
  <i>Vegavis iaai</i> dated 69 –66 million years ago, and this organ is unlikely
  to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs.
</p>

<p>
  On the basis that non-avian dinosaurs did not have syrinxes and that their
  next close living relatives, crocodilians, use the larynx, Phil Senter, a
  paleontologist, has suggested that the non-avians could not vocalize, because
  the common ancestor would have been mute. He states that they mostly on visual
  displays and possibly non-vocal sounds, such as hissing, jaw-grinding or
  -clapping, splashing, and wing-beating (possible in winged maniraptoran
  dinosaurs). Other researchers have countered that vocalizations also exist in
  turtles, the closest relatives of archosaurs, suggesting that the trait is
  ancestral to their lineage. In addition, vocal communication in dinosaurs is
  indicated by the development of advanced hearing in nearly all major groups.
  Hence the syrinx may have supplemented and then replaced the larynx as a vocal
  organ, without a "silent period" in bird evolution.
</p>
<p>
  In 2023, a fossilized larynx was described, from a specimen of the
  ankylosaurid <i>Pinacosaurus</i>. The structure was composed of cricoid and
  arytenoid cartilages, similar to those of non-avian reptiles; but the mobile
  cricoid–arytenoid joint and long arytenoid cartilages would have allowed
  air-flow control similar to that of birds, and thus could have made bird-like
  vocalizations. In addition, the cartilages were ossified, implying that
  laryngeal ossification is a feature of some non-avian dinosaurs. A 2016 study
  concludes that some dinosaurs may have produced closed-mouth vocalizations,
  such as cooing, hooting, and booming. These occur in both reptiles and birds
  and involve inflating the esophagus or tracheal pouches. Such vocalizations
  evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases
  in body size. The crests of some hadrosaurids and the nasal chambers of
  ankylosaurids may have been resonators.
</p>

<h3>Reproductive biology</h3>
<link
  rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"
  href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1236090951"
/>

<p>
  All dinosaurs laid amniotic eggs. Dinosaur eggs were usually laid in a nest.
  Most species create somewhat elaborate nests which can be cups, domes, plates,
  beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some species of modern bird have no nests;
  the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male
  emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and
  many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males
  primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional
  oviduct and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two
  oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as <i>Troodon</i>,
  exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one
  or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until
  all eggs were laid.
</p>
<p>
  When laying eggs, females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer
  bone and the marrow of their limbs. This medullary bone, which is rich in
  calcium, is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a
  <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct
  dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the
  sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone
  in the carnosaur <i>Allosaurus</i> and the ornithopod <i>Tenontosaurus</i>.
  Because the line of dinosaurs that includes <i>Allosaurus</i> and
  <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> diverged from the line that led to
  <i>Tenontosaurus</i> very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests
  that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all
  dinosaurs.
</p>

<p>
  Another widespread trait among modern birds (but see below in regards to
  fossil groups and extant megapodes) is parental care for young after hatching.
  Jack Horner's 1978 discovery of a <i>Maiasaura</i> ("good mother lizard")
  nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after
  birth among ornithopods. A specimen of the oviraptorid
  <i>Citipati osmolskae</i> was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position
  in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of
  feathers to keep the eggs warm. An embryo of the basal sauropodomorph
  <i>Massospondylus</i> was found without teeth, indicating that some parental
  care was required to feed the young dinosaurs. Trackways have also confirmed
  parental behavior among ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern
  Scotland.
</p>
<p>
  However, there is ample evidence of precociality or superprecociality among
  many dinosaur species, particularly theropods. For instance,
  non-ornithuromorph birds have been abundantly demonstrated to have had slow
  growth rates, megapode-like egg burying behavior and the ability to fly soon
  after birth. Both <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and <i>Troodon</i> had juveniles with
  clear superprecociality and likely occupying different ecological niches than
  the adults. Superprecociality has been inferred for sauropods.
</p>
<p>
  Genital structures are unlikely to fossilize as they lack scales that may
  allow preservation via pigmentation or residual calcium phosphate salts. In
  2021, the best preserved specimen of a dinosaur's cloacal vent exterior was
  described for <i>Psittacosaurus</i>, demonstrating lateral swellings similar
  to crocodylian musk glands used in social displays by both sexes and pigmented
  regions which could also reflect a signalling function. However, this specimen
  on its own does not offer enough information to determine whether this
  dinosaur had sexual signalling functions; it only supports the possibility.
  Cloacal visual signalling can occur in either males or females in living
  birds, making it unlikely to be useful to determine sex for extinct dinosaurs.
</p>

<h3>Physiology</h3>
<link
  rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"
  href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1236090951"
/>
<p>
  Because both modern crocodilians and birds have four-chambered hearts (albeit
  modified in crocodilians), it is likely that this is a trait shared by all
  archosaurs, including all dinosaurs. While all modern birds have high
  metabolisms and are endothermic ("warm-blooded"), a vigorous debate has been
  ongoing since the 1960s regarding how far back in the dinosaur lineage this
  trait extended. Various researchers have supported dinosaurs as being
  endothermic, ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), or somewhere in between. An
  emerging consensus among researchers is that, while different lineages of
  dinosaurs would have had different metabolisms, most of them had higher
  metabolic rates than other reptiles but lower than living birds and mammals,
  which is termed mesothermy by some. Evidence from crocodiles and their extinct
  relatives suggests that such elevated metabolisms could have developed in the
  earliest archosaurs, which were the common ancestors of dinosaurs and
  crocodiles.
</p>

<p>
  After non-avian dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that
  they were ectothermic. This was used to imply that the ancient dinosaurs were
  relatively slow, sluggish organisms, even though many modern reptiles are fast
  and light-footed despite relying on external sources of heat to regulate their
  body temperature. The idea of dinosaurs as ectothermic remained a prevalent
  view until Robert T. Bakker, an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy,
  published an influential paper on the topic in 1968. Bakker specifically used
  anatomical and ecological evidence to argue that sauropods, which had hitherto
  been depicted as sprawling aquatic animals with their tails dragging on the
  ground, were endotherms that lived vigorous, terrestrial lives. In 1972,
  Bakker expanded on his arguments based on energy requirements and
  predator-prey ratios. This was one of the seminal results that led to the
  dinosaur renaissance.

  One of the greatest contributions to the modern understanding of dinosaur
  physiology has been paleohistology, the study of microscopic tissue structure
  in dinosaurs. From the 1960s forward, Armand de Ricqlès suggested that the
  presence of fibrolamellar bone—bony tissue with an irregular, fibrous texture
  and filled with blood vessels—was indicative of consistently fast growth and
  therefore endothermy. Fibrolamellar bone was common in both dinosaurs and
  pterosaurs, though not universally present. This has led to a significant body
  of work in reconstructing growth curves and modeling the evolution of growth
  rates across various dinosaur lineages, which has suggested overall that
  dinosaurs grew faster than living reptiles. Other lines of evidence suggesting
  endothermy include the presence of feathers and other types of body coverings
  in many lineages (see § Feathers); more consistent ratios of the isotope
  oxygen-18 in bony tissue compared to ectotherms, particularly as latitude and
  thus air temperature varied, which suggests stable internal temperatures
  (although these ratios can be altered during fossilization); and the discovery
  of polar dinosaurs, which lived in Australia, Antarctica, and Alaska when
  these places would have had cool, temperate climates.

  In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were supported by the evolution
  of the avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air
  sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton,
  making them hollow. Such respiratory systems, which may have appeared in the
  earliest saurischians, would have provided them with more oxygen compared to a
  mammal of similar size, while also having a larger resting tidal volume and
  requiring a lower breathing frequency, which would have allowed them to
  sustain higher activity levels. The rapid airflow would also have been an
  effective cooling mechanism, which in conjunction with a lower metabolic rate
  would have prevented large sauropods from overheating. These traits may have
  enabled sauropods to grow quickly to gigantic sizes. Sauropods may also have
  benefitted from their size—their small surface area to volume ratio meant that
  they would have been able to thermoregulate more easily, a phenomenon termed
  gigantothermy.

  Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are primarily uricotelic, that is, their
  kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as
  uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. This
  would have helped them to conserve water. In most living species, uric acid is
  excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, at least some modern
  birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most
  of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. This material, as well as the output of
  the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate
  pellets, and fossil pellets are known as early as the Jurassic from
  <i>Anchiornis</i>.

  <span id="intelligence"></span>The size and shape of the brain can be partly
  reconstructed based on the surrounding bones. In 1896, Marsh calculated ratios
  between brain weight and body weight of seven species of dinosaurs, showing
  that the brain of dinosaurs was proportionally smaller than in today's
  crocodiles, and that the brain of <i>Stegosaurus</i> was smaller than in any
  living land vertebrate. This contributed to the widespread public notion of
  dinosaurs as being sluggish and extraordinarily stupid. Harry Jerison, in
  1973, showed that proportionally smaller brains are expected at larger body
  sizes, and that brain size in dinosaurs was not smaller than expected when
  compared to living reptiles. Later research showed that relative brain size
  progressively increased during the evolution of theropods, with the highest
  intelligence – comparable to that of modern birds – calculated for the
  troodontid <i>Troodon</i>.
