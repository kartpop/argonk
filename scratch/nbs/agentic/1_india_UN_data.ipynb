      "- **Protection of Biodiversity**: The number of threatened species continues to grow, from 758 to 1,193, indicating worsening environmental health despite efforts to increase forest area (from 23.4% to 24.1%).\n",
      "- **Energy Production**: Energy production has seen slight increases, suggesting progress in energy supply, which is critical for India’s economic activities.\n",
      "- **Tourism Growth**: There has been significant growth in tourism, from 5.8 million visitors in 2010 to over 17.4 million in 2021, highlighting the potential for tourism as a growing economic sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Economic Growth with Challenges**: India has shown substantial GDP growth, but the GDP per capita indicates ongoing challenges in inequality.\n",
      "2. **Urbanization**: Increasing urbanization is visible, with a corresponding rise in infrastructure needs and potential social issues such as housing and employment.\n",
      "3. **Slow Population Growth**: The declining birth rates may lead to an aging population in the upcoming decades, needing policy adaptations.\n",
      "4. **Environmental Concerns**: Growing threats to biodiversity and increasing CO2 emissions per capita underscore the need for stronger environmental policies.\n",
      "5. **Education and Healthcare**: Continued investment in education and healthcare is critical to maintain the growth trajectory and improve living standards across the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while India's economic indicators show promising growth, social and environmental areas require attention for sustainable development.\n"
